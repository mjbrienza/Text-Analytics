      "As most of you already know the Controlling Hypertension eCQM measure is a required reporting measure for CPC+ PY 2018. As we are closing and reporting Hypertension Measure numbers for CPC+ 2017, we noticed some areas for possible improvement, not just with our process of dealing with hypertension patients but with the eCQM itself. During our process of closing PY 2017 patient gaps, we noticed that patients who had been seen by providers for a follow up visit on a previously reported high blood pressure were not counting in our numerator as ?controlled.? Initially we were unsure why these patients were not counting in our numerator, but after further investigation we discovered that our providers coded the visit as a ?no charge? visit. These visits were care management visits performed by the provider. The controlled blood pressure, however, was not counted toward our numerator because the visit was coded as a ?no charge? visit. Many could argue that another trained team member, (i.e. a care manager), could be doing care management for this patient?s blood pressure; however, if this were the case, we still would not get credit for the patient?s controlled blood pressure for two reasons:A provider did not see the patientThe provider did not charge for the visitOffering care management services not only helps the patient maintain and control their health but also helps reduce the cost of healthcare. Given that here are a few questions:Why does a provider have to bill for services for in order to get credit for the patient/visit in this measure? Does charging for the visit change the fact that the patient had a controlled blood pressure?If a patient has already been seen for a visit with a provider within the measure year, comes into the clinic and sees another member of the care team (i.e. the care manager), and the patient has a documented, controlled blood pressure, why are we not allowing this to count towards the measure? Isn?t the care manager part of the ?care team? that the CPC+ model strongly encourages?The provider reviews the notes from care manager visits and can intervene with a visit if needed. Is this not a great example of smarter spending and also of ?top of license? for care team members?How can we expect to reduce costs if we have to charge patients for any visit that is required to count for measures?Essentially to capture a controlled blood pressure and to also get credit for this in our eCQM reporting, a provider has to see the patient and also has to charge for the visit. This seems contradictory to what we are trying accomplish under the CPC+ triple aim ? namely better care and smarter spending. Is anyone else encountering this? If so, how are you addressing it?\n",

This variance comes from different attribution methods and time frames. Because we report on our \"active patient panel\" for total practice patients but recorded the carrier provided \"attributed\" patients by carrier, it appear that our percentage of patient participating in CPC+ is lower. Will this be considered a negative outcome for our practice. 2) CMS has limitations on the type of expenses allowed using CPC+ funds. However, various carriers had no limitations on what the funds could be used for. When entering the expense totals, there was no way to identify what CPC+ revenue funds were used for specific expenses. Is there a way to add supporting clarification on expenses? 3) CMS and another major carrier for our practice included FFS Alternative payments as part of their CPC+ financial support. The FFS Alternative Payments were included in the CPC+ revenue. However, these funds were an off-set of A/R income. This made the total CPC+ revenue appear much greater than what we considered as additional CPC+ revenue support. So, it appears that we would have a large amount of CPC+ revenue carry over from 2017. From our perspective, we need to match revenue and expenses. So we either need to move the FFS Alternative Payments out of CPC+ revenue or move standard practice expenses over to CPC+ to reflect the lost A/R income. I hope that makes sense and would appreciate input. Thanks, Carol\n",

However, our system (which includes 8 Track 2 CPC+ practices) is somewhat unique in that we have interchangeable staff, providers and patients across our clinics. Therefore, it is not feasible for our system to conduct individual PFAC meetings without causing a great deal of frustration and confusion for staff, providers and patients. Rather, for the past 4 + years we have had a highly-functioning, system-wide PFAC with patient representation from all of our clinics, and attended by our organization?s leadership, administration, and providers from across our organization, so that we can implement systemic changes/improvements so that patients, staff and providers are not confused by inconsistencies as they move from one physical location to another. Are there other systems in CPC+ with these same challenges?We have been able to overcome this challenge in other programs, including CPC classic, and SIM when practice facilitation was required to have meetings at each individual office caused large problems because certain things were being changed at one location rather than across our organization and PCPs and patients, alike, complained because of the confusion when they were working or being seen at another location. We were able to come to an agreement that with participation from each location, we could have one central meeting to achieve the intent of the requirement for meetings. I?m hoping that this will be the same way. Can a collaborative approach meet the CPC+ requirement if we can document the system-wide representation? Thanks in advance. \n",

It's a new year, so all HCC scores have reset back to zero, and the CY 2018 HCC scores will impact CMF payments Q3-2019 through Q2-2020:Do you have an EHR solution? Other IT vendor?Maybe an external tracking spreadsheet?An awesome in-house coder?I'd love to hear everyone's ideas on how to keep track of HCC's, how to ensure they get billed correctly, how to make sure they don't get forgotten, HCC 'tips and tricks', and the like.I'll start. As I see it, there are two elements to good HCC coding. One is to code as accurately as possible and re-code each HCC ICD-10 every year (e.g. they probably have the same below-the-knee amputation Z89.519 this year that they had last year.) The other element is to 'mine' the medical record for missed opportunities (e.g. senile purpura D69.2) Doing Annual Wellness Visits is a good way to keep track of those codes than need billed and re-billed every year. I'm still struggling with how to 'mine' the chart for missed opportunities.BTW, a good resource to checkHCC scores ishttp://www.hccuniversity.com/risk-score-calculator/BTW#2, don't forget the MEAT. For a diagnosis to be properly documented/supported, it must have the following four elements addressed in the progress note:Monitoring, Evaluating, Assessing/Addressing, & Treating. In other words, if someone comes in for a sinus infection, you can't just throw a bunch of HCC ICD-10 codes in the chart. You must include the MEAT! So if you address their E11.65 Type 2 Diabetes with hyperglycemia when they are in for the sinus infection, you should document that and include it.\n",

A CPC+ practitioner interacts with a specialist via secure messages to receive help in developing a care plan for an individual Eligible Beneficiary. For example, the PCP sends a dermatologist a photo of a patient's rash and the dermatologist advises on treatment options. As another example, a PCP contacts a cardiologist or psychiatrist to request advice on changing a patient's medication dose. In both cases, the CPC+ practitioner is expending time on behalf of the patient and potentially avoiding a visit to a specialist. That said, it isn't a direct interaction with the patient, but rather an interaction with a specialist on behalf of a patient.This doesn't match any of the alternative visit types listed on 7 of the Care Delivery Reporting Guide.

They are wanting to put in a urgentcare center in which one of the Dr's in a CPC+ practice is the medical director of this urgentcare. The Dr and NP they are purposing to running the urgentcarearenotpart of the original CPC+ office. If this Dr and NPhavereal time access to the pt.'s office chart could this be considered an alternate care setting or would this affect the continuity of care numbers since the actual CPC+ Dr. is not seeing the pt.?

If this would not be acceptableI give the following scenarioDr and NP jointhisCPC+ practice and are accepted as part of the CPC+ practice then if they covered this urgent care would it be considered an alternate care site?

      "Hi Elisha: I appreciate your response, but I don't think that I'm asking the question the right way. I understand how the historical payment was originally calculated but am concerned that as the future E&M claims decrease, the historical payment will also be reduced. This would ultimately result in \"defunding\" the entire CPCP process over time, if we successfully implement alternative visits. Without the continued funding, we would not be able to support the alternative visit models.Glad to hear that beneficiary cost sharing is not impacted. However, I've done some in-depth cost analysis and without full beneficiary payment for their 20% co-insurance as well as the majority of the annual deductible amount, each individual CPCP level of decrease results in a financial loss for the practice.Another concern we have, is the decrease in payments for E&M services provided in our after-hours clinic which is an ancillary division, not part of the CPC+ practice. We provide after-hours coverage 7 days a week until 10 PM. This keepsthe vast majorityof our patients out of the ED. But there are times that our CPC+ providers work shifts at the after-hours clinic. Just because we are under 1 TIN, doesn't seem fair that this ancillary division should be penalized with a reduced payment. They do not benefit from the CPCP payments but yet receive a lesser E&M payment.I think our biggest concern is the decreasing E&M claims that would impact the historical amount. If we do our job at collecting beneficiary co-payments and deductibles, we should see the negative amountturn into a positive cash flow. But, we would ask that CMS take a second look at the impact on any after-hours facility and exclude them from reduced E&M payment. Thanks, Carol\n",

      "We have not made our final decision yet but certainly will by tomorrow's deadline. As with everyone, we are trying to understand the financial implications of our decision. Although the payment methodology documentation is extensive, there are several unanswered questions. From our actual CPCP payment, we have worked backwards to determine the historical payment on which the CPCP is based. We realize that there will be potential FFSchanges due to the shifting look back period, but we used the initial gross historical amount for future calculations. I then compared our actual E&M utilization and allowed amounts for each E&Mfor the past year and applied the various percentages to determine the projected CPCP and the reduction in our FFS payment. The net result is a loss with every calculations prior to taking into consideration the patient's portion of the payment. My assumption is that the patient's portion will not change, but I can't determine beyond the 20% co-insurance, what portion of the annual deductible might apply to services that we provide. Even adjusting for the patients 20% co-insurance, the CPCP payment is less than the reduced FFS. If the patient's annual deductible is paid to our practice, that will likely bring us to a breakeven point but not if the patient's deductible was applied to another providers services. Second major concern (point of clarification) is that with the alternative visit approach, that means a reduction in E&M billing which in turn will lessen the historical look back amounts. If we are to sustain the alternative visit model, we will need to maintain funding to support the alternative process including staff and programming. Perhaps I'm missing a key element of the payment methodology. If so, I would greatly appreciate any additional information.\n",

      "SOMEBODY LISTENED!  Positive changes for better attribution! From the most recent newsletter:The current CPC+ attribution algorithm attributes beneficiaries in two major steps: (1) attribute beneficiaries to practices based on Chronic Care Management (CCM) service billings, if a CCM service is the most recent claim during the 24-month look back period; and (2) attribute remaining beneficiaries to practices on the basis of the plurality of eligible primary care visits.Beginning in Q1 2018, CMS will add a new second step to this algorithm. After attributing beneficiaries based on CCM services, CMS will attribute beneficiaries based on the most recent Annual Wellness Visit or Welcome to Medicare Visit. Then, remaining beneficiaries will be attributed on the plurality of eligible primary care visits. We expect prioritizing Annual Wellness Visits and Welcome to Medicare Visits in the attribution methodology will help many practices maintain or increase their attribution over time, especially as they implement more flexible ways of providing care to beneficiaries that are not dependent on an Evaluation & Management office visit. Additionally, activities under the Annual Wellness Visit and the Welcome to Medicare Visit are consistent with CMS's aims under CPC+, and we encourage practices to offer these services. An updated CPC+ Payment Methodologies FAQ will soon be available on CPC+ ConnectI did not know about the CCM service as a method for attribution. For our new patients to be attributed, we will start providing this service for those were eligible and try to get them in for a wellness visit in the near future. Unfortunately, they did not accept my recommendation for a new patient code triggering attribution :(But overall this is better. Thank you for those at CMMI, CMS and anybody else who lobbied for this change\n",

Not every provider is fully \"bought-in\", and some just don't think about the comprehensiveness added to the practices (and some may just not care as much).What I am trying to propose is an incentive plan that will reward the physicians appropriately for the work they are actually doing under CPC+ Funding (and related to the performance-based incentive payment). Obviously, this is a complicated topic. However, the PBIP is paid to the practice according to the practice-level performance.

I reviewed the medical records and of those with different risk levels, the patient was seen during Q1 2017 with multiple problems addressed during the visits.  So it appears the increase in Risk level could be a result of the most recent visit and attention to appropriate HCC coding.  But, I'm also seeing an increase in the over all region which is interesting.  In the Q17 CPCI Feedback report prepared in April 217, the region average was 0.601 and in the CPC+ 217 Report 2, the average region was 0.9.  This is what I'm trying to understand.

      "CQM CMS 166 Imaging with Low Back PainI would appreciate some input from other practices who have focused on this cqm. As we wade through the details of exceptions, trauma codes, etc. and drilled down our data we are see a common recurring scenario:Patient falls from stool, ladder,or motor vehicle accident, etc, comes to office for evaluation. In order to determine if a fracture has occurred we need to provide appropriate imaging. The image returns with no fracture. Good news for the patient; however, we now see that our CQM status is\"not compliant\"for thenumerator since there was not awaiting period for the28 days. Since the patient did not have a fracturethe \"S\"trauma codes were not applicable.We find now thatthe practice no longer meets the CQM requirement.I realize this is tedious; however, if you have a low volume of these office visits, each one has a large impact on the threshold percentage. I may be missing a piece of the puzzle for the CQM as well or misreading something.Does any practice have any suggestions for appropriate documentationfor these situations ? We understand the spirit of the CQM is to wait with a strain or pain, but it would be inappropriate for the practice to not image a patient under these circumstances. The work around would be to send to the ED, but that goes against the PCMH model and the goal of reducing health care costs. (Interestingly, one of the patient visits in question did go to the ED where no xray was taken, opioids /muscle relaxers /PT rx was given. We had to then reassess the patient as an initial diagnosis when they came to the office a week later in significant pain to see if they had a fracture.

Because thesepayments are CMS's way of prospectively paying for care management, our care managers were instructed not to drop codes for any payer. However, we've recently received word from Blue Cross and Priority Health (our Michigan payer partners)that these codes need to start being dropped so that we can continue to receive payments for the provided services, and to continue to receiveour incentive dollars. Dropping these codes also helps us track the activities our care managers, and to determine productivity.Having said that, does anyone know ifit would be okay for our care managers to drop care management codes (i.e. G9001 and G9002)to CMS as a $0 charge (i.e. dropping the code but not charging anything for it)?

In our case, there is no way for an RNCC to deal with more than 100-150 patients.This is allowing for about .5-.6 FTE for this (RNCC)job outside of other duties, meetings etc. This means phone calls, one on one visits (billed as 99211), risk stratification:andIt of course varies on documentation requirements and whether these are linked to your EMR. We have had the experience of using many risk stratification tools, unlinked to the EMR (MCG, Truvan and others) and the greater the documentation requirements the lower the personal impact on patients, and less value seen by the physicians/providers in practice. If you have to \"double enter\" patients into some sort of \"counting\" scheme (IE stratification and tracking not linked to your EMR), this is a barrier to integrated services and efficient care delivery. Double documentation reduces the effectiveness of coordinators very significantly.Some commercial interests (outside care management companies, insurers) would suggest that this is not a big enough panel size for RNCC's but we are dealing with multiplephysical, mental health, and social determinants in the cases managed by our coordinators.

I may be misunderstanding the numerator/denominator, but if we enter it once, it goes to the numerator and denominator, if they have two more visits and we don't enter that particular item again, the numerator stays the same but the denominator raises by two?? Is that how this will work? Using the mammogram as an example again - the numerator states - women with one or more mammograms during the measurement period or the 15 months prior to the measurement period. Denominator states - equals initial population. Record once in the EHR or at each visit during 2017? Any help is appreciated!!\n",

      "I have a question about the use of Care Management Fees (CMF) for certain services. We have been talking with a private Primary Care Group of over 200 providers, who operate a very efficient Inpatient service at a hospital that is not part of our system. Through utilization of a lot of wraparound services they have a readmission rate in the single digits. We want to utilize our CPC resources to provide new care opportunities for our patients around hospital sensitive conditions at a hospital that is not part of our system, but where a number of our patients receive their care.\n",
      "\n",
      "We would like to have this group manage our patients who go to this Hospital, and although the providers will bill for their professional services, the wraparound services are not billable so we will need to help support that. I am emailing to see if we can use CMF dollars for that?\n",
      "\n",
      "They have transition of care services as follows:  An RN and physician in the ED from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. to assess if patients need to be admitted they work with and collaborate with the ED physicians of that institution. They often schedule patients to see their primary care provider the following day such that admission and or an observation unit  stay is not need it. All of our patients who go to the ED would receive the service. They also track patient utilization data and share that with us. For patients who need observation they have  an inpatient observation unit that can  also be used to bypass the ER for all but the sickest. They staff the unit with  transition of care nurses to support the physicians in this environment. We would be able to contact them for a direct observation admit and bypass the ED. They also do post-hospital follow up and 48 hour phone call evaluations, but we would continue to do that ourselves. For patients who are admitted they have an inpatient support center staffed 24/7 / 365 with their Physicians, Pharmacists,  and Critical Care Nurses to efficiently manage patients both in the observation unit, inpatient setting, and ER Area.\n",

      "As most of you already know the Controlling Hypertension eCQM measure is a required reporting measure for CPC+ PY 2018. As we are closing and reporting Hypertension Measure numbers for CPC+ 2017, we noticed some areas for possible improvement, not just with our process of dealing with hypertension patients but with the eCQM itself. During our process of closing PY 2017 patient gaps, we noticed that patients who had been seen by providers for a follow up visit on a previously reported high blood pressure were not counting in our numerator as ?controlled.? Initially we were unsure why these patients were not counting in our numerator, but after further investigation we discovered that our providers coded the visit as a ?no charge? visit. These visits were care management visits performed by the provider. The controlled blood pressure, however, was not counted toward our numerator because the visit was coded as a ?no charge? visit. Many could argue that another trained team member, (i.e. a care manager), could be doing care management for this patient?s blood pressure; however, if this were the case, we still would not get credit for the patient?s controlled blood pressure for two reasons:A provider did not see the patientThe provider did not charge for the visitOffering care management services not only helps the patient maintain and control their health but also helps reduce the cost of healthcare. Given that here are a few questions:Why does a provider have to bill for services for in order to get credit for the patient/visit in this measure? Does charging for the visit change the fact that the patient had a controlled blood pressure?If a patient has already been seen for a visit with a provider within the measure year, comes into the clinic and sees another member of the care team (i.e. the care manager), and the patient has a documented, controlled blood pressure, why are we not allowing this to count towards the measure? Isn?t the care manager part of the ?care team? that the CPC+ model strongly encourages?The provider reviews the notes from care manager visits and can intervene with a visit if needed. Is this not a great example of smarter spending and also of ?top of license? for care team members?How can we expect to reduce costs if we have to charge patients for any visit that is required to count for measures?Essentially to capture a controlled blood pressure and to also get credit for this in our eCQM reporting, a provider has to see the patient and also has to charge for the visit. This seems contradictory to what we are trying accomplish under the CPC+ triple aim ? namely better care and smarter spending. Is anyone else encountering this? If so, how are you addressing it?\n",

      "After completing the Financial Reporting, I have 3 questions that I'd like feedback on. 1) The number of lives reflected on the carrier attribution reports sometimes vary greatly compared to what we consider our current \"active patient panel\". This variance comes from different attribution methods and time frames. Because we report on our \"active patient panel\" for total practice patients but recorded the carrier provided \"attributed\" patients by carrier, it appear that our percentage of patient participating in CPC+ is lower. Will this be considered a negative outcome for our practice. 2) CMS has limitations on the type of expenses allowed using CPC+ funds. However, various carriers had no limitations on what the funds could be used for. When entering the expense totals, there was no way to identify what CPC+ revenue funds were used for specific expenses. Is there a way to add supporting clarification on expenses? 3) CMS and another major carrier for our practice included FFS Alternative payments as part of their CPC+ financial support. The FFS Alternative Payments were included in the CPC+ revenue. However, these funds were an off-set of A/R income. This made the total CPC+ revenue appear much greater than what we considered as additional CPC+ revenue support. So, it appears that we would have a large amount of CPC+ revenue carry over from 2017. From our perspective, we need to match revenue and expenses. So we either need to move the FFS Alternative Payments out of CPC+ revenue or move standard practice expenses over to CPC+ to reflect the lost A/R income. I hope that makes sense and would appreciate input. Thanks, Carol\n",

      "We are seeking guidance regarding PFAC requirements in 2018 due to our unique circumstances. We understand that the requirement states that PFACs must be specific to each CPC+ ID #. However, our system (which includes 8 Track 2 CPC+ practices) is somewhat unique in that we have interchangeable staff, providers and patients across our clinics. Therefore, it is not feasible for our system to conduct individual PFAC meetings without causing a great deal of frustration and confusion for staff, providers and patients. Rather, for the past 4 + years we have had a highly-functioning, system-wide PFAC with patient representation from all of our clinics, and attended by our organization?s leadership, administration, and providers from across our organization, so that we can implement systemic changes/improvements so that patients, staff and providers are not confused by inconsistencies as they move from one physical location to another. Are there other systems in CPC+ with these same challenges?We have been able to overcome this challenge in other programs, including CPC classic, and SIM when practice facilitation was required to have meetings at each individual office caused large problems because certain things were being changed at one location rather than across our organization and PCPs and patients, alike, complained because of the confusion when they were working or being seen at another location. We were able to come to an agreement that with participation from each location, we could have one central meeting to achieve the intent of the requirement for meetings. I?m hoping that this will be the same way. Can a collaborative approach meet the CPC+ requirement if we can document the system-wide representation? Thanks in advance. \n",

It's a new year, so all HCC scores have reset back to zero, and the CY 2018 HCC scores will impact CMF payments Q3-2019 through Q2-2020:Do you have an EHR solution? Other IT vendor?Maybe an external tracking spreadsheet?An awesome in-house coder?I'd love to hear everyone's ideas on how to keep track of HCC's, how to ensure they get billed correctly, how to make sure they don't get forgotten, HCC 'tips and tricks', and the like.I'll start. As I see it, there are two elements to good HCC coding. One is to code as accurately as possible and re-code each HCC ICD-10 every year (e.g. they probably have the same below-the-knee amputation Z89.519 this year that they had last year.) The other element is to 'mine' the medical record for missed opportunities (e.g. senile purpura D69.2) Doing Annual Wellness Visits is a good way to keep track of those codes than need billed and re-billed every year. I'm still struggling with how to 'mine' the chart for missed opportunities.BTW, a good resource to checkHCC scores ishttp://www.hccuniversity.com/risk-score-calculator/BTW#2, don't forget the MEAT. For a diagnosis to be properly documented/supported, it must have the following four elements addressed in the progress note:Monitoring, Evaluating, Assessing/Addressing, & Treating. In other words, if someone comes in for a sinus infection, you can't just throw a bunch of HCC ICD-10 codes in the chart. You must include the MEAT! So if you address their E11.65 Type 2 Diabetes with hyperglycemia when they are in for the sinus infection, you should document that and include it.\n",

My question relates to the adjustment of the score.Do we have to be able to \"report\" on the adjusted score?Our EHR uses an algorithm to produce a risk score. We do not currently have the capability to adjust that risk score in our EHR. If we were to \"adjust\" the risk score based on care team perception, we would put that in a Care Coordination note (e.g. Risk score of 9, but provider considers actual risk to be 11). We couldn't report on that in any way.Is that sufficient? The alternative would be to output the risk scores to a file, and then maintain an Excel file that shows the adjusted risk score.

Several well-known patients will be given a survey at check in, and they'll be asked to list all staff members that mentioned our same day appointments, etc. Staff names will be drawn every couple weeks.

      "Does the following scenario count as an alternative visit for CPC+ care delivery reporting? A CPC+ practitioner interacts with a specialist via secure messages to receive help in developing a care plan for an individual Eligible Beneficiary. For example, the PCP sends a dermatologist a photo of a patient's rash and the dermatologist advises on treatment options. As another example, a PCP contacts a cardiologist or psychiatrist to request advice on changing a patient's medication dose. In both cases, the CPC+ practitioner is expending time on behalf of the patient and potentially avoiding a visit to a specialist. That said, it isn't a direct interaction with the patient, but rather an interaction with a specialist on behalf of a patient.This doesn't match any of the alternative visit types listed on 7 of the Care Delivery Reporting Guide. Could it be included as an \"Other\" type?Also, would these scenarios qualify as use of CPCP funds?

      "Hi Elisha: I appreciate your response, but I don't think that I'm asking the question the right way. I understand how the historical payment was originally calculated but am concerned that as the future E&M claims decrease, the historical payment will also be reduced. This would ultimately result in \"defunding\" the entire CPCP process over time, if we successfully implement alternative visits. Without the continued funding, we would not be able to support the alternative visit models.Glad to hear that beneficiary cost sharing is not impacted. However, I've done some in-depth cost analysis and without full beneficiary payment for their 20% co-insurance as well as the majority of the annual deductible amount, each individual CPCP level of decrease results in a financial loss for the practice.Another concern we have, is the decrease in payments for E&M services provided in our after-hours clinic which is an ancillary division, not part of the CPC+ practice. We provide after-hours coverage 7 days a week until 10 PM. This keepsthe vast majorityof our patients out of the ED. But there are times that our CPC+ providers work shifts at the after-hours clinic. Just because we are under 1 TIN, doesn't seem fair that this ancillary division should be penalized with a reduced payment. They do not benefit from the CPCP payments but yet receive a lesser E&M payment.I think our biggest concern is the decreasing E&M claims that would impact the historical amount. If we do our job at collecting beneficiary co-payments and deductibles, we should see the negative amountturn into a positive cash flow. But, we would ask that CMS take a second look at the impact on any after-hours facility and exclude them from reduced E&M payment. Thanks, Carol\n",

      "We have not made our final decision yet but certainly will by tomorrow's deadline. As with everyone, we are trying to understand the financial implications of our decision. Although the payment methodology documentation is extensive, there are several unanswered questions. From our actual CPCP payment, we have worked backwards to determine the historical payment on which the CPCP is based. We realize that there will be potential FFSchanges due to the shifting look back period, but we used the initial gross historical amount for future calculations. I then compared our actual E&M utilization and allowed amounts for each E&Mfor the past year and applied the various percentages to determine the projected CPCP and the reduction in our FFS payment. The net result is a loss with every calculations prior to taking into consideration the patient's portion of the payment. My assumption is that the patient's portion will not change, but I can't determine beyond the 20% co-insurance, what portion of the annual deductible might apply to services that we provide. Even adjusting for the patients 20% co-insurance, the CPCP payment is less than the reduced FFS. If the patient's annual deductible is paid to our practice, that will likely bring us to a breakeven point but not if the patient's deductible was applied to another providers services. Second major concern (point of clarification) is that with the alternative visit approach, that means a reduction in E&M billing which in turn will lessen the historical look back amounts. If we are to sustain the alternative visit model, we will need to maintain funding to support the alternative process including staff and programming. Perhaps I'm missing a key element of the payment methodology. If so, I would greatly appreciate any additional information.\n",

The results of the program will be presented to the patient council. The council will determine if the goasl of improved balance and reduced falls were achieved.

      "SOMEBODY LISTENED!  Positive changes for better attribution! From the most recent newsletter:The current CPC+ attribution algorithm attributes beneficiaries in two major steps: (1) attribute beneficiaries to practices based on Chronic Care Management (CCM) service billings, if a CCM service is the most recent claim during the 24-month look back period; and (2) attribute remaining beneficiaries to practices on the basis of the plurality of eligible primary care visits.Beginning in Q1 2018, CMS will add a new second step to this algorithm. After attributing beneficiaries based on CCM services, CMS will attribute beneficiaries based on the most recent Annual Wellness Visit or Welcome to Medicare Visit. Then, remaining beneficiaries will be attributed on the plurality of eligible primary care visits. We expect prioritizing Annual Wellness Visits and Welcome to Medicare Visits in the attribution methodology will help many practices maintain or increase their attribution over time, especially as they implement more flexible ways of providing care to beneficiaries that are not dependent on an Evaluation & Management office visit. Additionally, activities under the Annual Wellness Visit and the Welcome to Medicare Visit are consistent with CMS's aims under CPC+, and we encourage practices to offer these services. An updated CPC+ Payment Methodologies FAQ will soon be available on CPC+ ConnectI did not know about the CCM service as a method for attribution. For our new patients to be attributed, we will start providing this service for those were eligible and try to get them in for a wellness visit in the near future. Unfortunately, they did not accept my recommendation for a new patient code triggering attribution :(But overall this is better.

      "I was catching up on my CMS newsletters and spotted this, which was sent out on 9/1: an update to the PBIP, which includes new, more relaxed percentiles for eCQM measures, already effective for 2017! Time to check back on our stats from the latest dashboard extraction!Here's the content of the newsletter from CMS:CMS Announces Updates to eCQM Value Sets for Q4 2017 Reporting, and 2018 Reporting and Performance PeriodsThe Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) and the National Library of Medicine (NLM) will publish updates to the electronic clinical quality measure (eCQM) value sets to align with the most recent releases to terminologies, including, but not limited to, International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10 Clinical Modification (CM) and Procedure Coding System (PCS), SNOMEDCT, LOINC, RxNorm, and Current Procedural Terminology (CPT). CMS will publish two addenda containing updates to these terminologies for the 4th Quarter (Q4) 2017 reporting period, and 2018 reporting and performance periods.When will the addenda be published and what programs are affected by the addenda?2017 Q4 Reporting Period eCQM Value Set Addendum:In September, CMS will publish an addendum to the eCQM specifications (published in April 2016) to update relevant eCQM value sets for Q4 2017 reporting. This addendum will affect the electronic reporting of eCQMs for the following hospital programs:Hospital Inpatient Quality Reporting (IQR) Program; andMedicare and Medicaid Electronic Health Record (EHR) Incentive Program for eligible hospitals and critical access hospitals (CAHs).The 2017 Q4 Reporting Period eCQM Value Set Addendum does not impact eCQM reporting for eligible professionals (EPs) in the Medicaid EHR Incentive Program or eligible clinicians in the Quality Payment Program.2018 Reporting/Performance Period eCQM Value Set Addendum:By October, CMS will publish an addendum to the eCQM specifications (published in May 2017) to update relevant eCQM value sets for the 2018 reporting year. This addendum will affect the electronic reporting of eCQMs for the following programs:Hospital IQR Program;Medicare and Medicaid EHR Incentive Program for eligible hospitals, CAHs, and EPs; andQuality Payment Program: Merit-based Incentive Payment System (MIPS) and Alternative Payment Models (APMs).What changes are included in the addenda?Changes will only affect the value sets for eCQMs. The Health Quality Measure Format (HQMF) specifications, the value set object identifiers (OIDs), and the measure version numbers for Q4 2017 eCQM reporting and 2018 eCQM reporting (Jan 1-Dec 31) will not change.The changes to the value sets consist of (1) deletion of expired codes, (2) addition of relevant replacement codes, and (3) addition of newly available codes that represent concepts consistent with the intent of the value set and corresponding measure(s).Where will CMS and the NLM post the addenda?All changes to the eCQM value sets will be available through theNLM?s Value Set Authority Center <http://links.govdelivery.com/track?type=click&enid=ZWFzPTEmbXNpZD0mYXVpZD0mbWFpbGluZ2lkPTIwMTcwOTAxLjc3NjIxMTAxJm1lc3NhZ2VpZD1NREItUFJELUJVTC0yMDE3MDkwMS43NzYyMTEwMSZkYXRhYmFzZWlkPTEwMDEmc2VyaWFsPTE4MDc5ODQ0JmVtYWlsaWQ9YWJsaW5uQGNvcnZhbGxpc2ZhbWlseW1lZGljaW5lLmNvbSZ1c2VyaWQ9YWJsaW5uQGNvcnZhbGxpc2ZhbWlseW1lZGljaW5lLmNvbSZ0YXJnZXRpZD0mZmw9JmV4dHJhPU11bHRpdmFyaWF0ZUlkPSYmJg==&&&100&&&https://vsac.nlm.nih.gov/download/> download tab.

Any others have reservations about making a short-term, emergency use trigger a disqualifying event?2) Meeting the metric at the 80th percentile (in other words, 20% of practices surveyed by CMS avoided HRME use below this rate) requires avoidance of any HRME at a rate BELOW 1 in 10,000 or 0.01% of empaneled patients >65 years old.

Not every provider is fully \"bought-in\", and some just don't think about the comprehensiveness added to the practices (and some may just not care as much).What I am trying to propose is an incentive plan that will reward the physicians appropriately for the work they are actually doing under CPC+ Funding (and related to the performance-based incentive payment). Obviously, this is a complicated topic. However, the PBIP is paid to the practice according to the practice-level performance. Those providers that fall short on several (or all) eCQMs, utilization, and the CAHPS, I think, should receive less of that bonus if the others are having to \"carry\" them withhigher numbers in order for the practice to keep some or all of it. We also have to keep in mind the volume, since many providers have been rewarded for that in the past.I am just not sure what this should look like, and I welcome any wisdom that you have regarding this issue.Thanks!\n",

Out of the 10 that I audited, 3 had different HCC levels in CPCI compared to their current CPC+ level.  I reviewed the medical records and of those with different risk levels, the patient was seen during Q1 2017 with multiple problems addressed during the visits.  So it appears the increase in Risk level could be a result of the most recent visit and attention to appropriate HCC coding.  But, I'm also seeing an increase in the over all region which is interesting.  In the Q17 CPCI Feedback report prepared in April 217, the region average was 0.601 and in the CPC+ 217 Report 2, the average region was 0.9.  This is what I'm trying to understand.  Hopefully everyone in the region is doing a better job with HCC scoring, but I also want to make sure we have an apples to apples comparison. \n",

Most of the time spent by everyone in the office (with the exception of care management, integrated behavioral health) is in providing traditional office visit services.

      "CQM CMS 166 Imaging with Low Back PainI would appreciate some input from other practices who have focused on this cqm. As we wade through the details of exceptions, trauma codes, etc. and drilled down our data we are see a common recurring scenario:Patient falls from stool, ladder,or motor vehicle accident, etc, comes to office for evaluation. In order to determine if a fracture has occurred we need to provide appropriate imaging. The image returns with no fracture. Good news for the patient; however, we now see that our CQM status is\"not compliant\"for thenumerator since there was not awaiting period for the28 days. Since the patient did not have a fracturethe \"S\"trauma codes were not applicable.We find now thatthe practice no longer meets the CQM requirement.I realize this is tedious; however, if you have a low volume of these office visits, each one has a large impact on the threshold percentage. I may be missing a piece of the puzzle for the CQM as well or misreading something.Does any practice have any suggestions for appropriate documentationfor these situations ? We understand the spirit of the CQM is to wait with a strain or pain, but it would be inappropriate for the practice to not image a patient under these circumstances. The work around would be to send to the ED, but that goes against the PCMH model and the goal of reducing health care costs. (Interestingly, one of the patient visits in question did go to the ED where no xray was taken, opioids /muscle relaxers /PT rx was given. We had to then reassess the patient as an initial diagnosis when they came to the office a week later in significant pain to see if they had a fracture. The hospital may have met their goal, but the practicedid not. )\n",

      "My practices have recently hit a barrier related to dropping care management codes and figuring out how to track the services care managers areproviding. Since we joinedthe CPC+ program, our ambulatory care managers have not been dropping care managementcodes for any payerbecause of the CMF payments we've been receiving from CMS. Because thesepayments are CMS's way of prospectively paying for care management, our care managers were instructed not to drop codes for any payer. However, we've recently received word from Blue Cross and Priority Health (our Michigan payer partners)that these codes need to start being dropped so that we can continue to receive payments for the provided services, and to continue to receiveour incentive dollars. Dropping these codes also helps us track the activities our care managers, and to determine productivity.Having said that, does anyone know ifit would be okay for our care managers to drop care management codes (i.e. G9001 and G9002)to CMS as a $0 charge (i.e. dropping the code but not charging anything for it)? I know CMS will not pay for the charge, but dropping these codes are our only way of tracking care management services that are provided.Any help you all can provide would be MUCH appreciated!\n",

We call and use a program to remind our patients before the appointment as well. When an appointment is missed a personalized letter is sent that day to the patient informing them they have missed the appointment and to reschedule. This letter also says that after your second missed appointment you will be charged a no show fee. It seems to be that the majority of missed appointments are physicals and then coming in second is follow ups.

I dug a little deeper, and I am seeing where the list of PQRS eligible professionals includes Doctor of Optometry. A 90%/+ benchmark might make sense for this specialty; however, without a significant focus of resources, thisremains seemingly unattainable - at least at this point - for primary care practices.

It looks like, from the criteria that I have read, that the patient must have a PHQ 9 of greater than 9 to be in the denominator, and then, a PHQ 9 of 5 or less on TWO separate instances, 1 instance greater than 10 months following the initial high PHQ 9, THEN ANOTHER less than 13 months after the initial high PHQ 9. Is this correct? Does this really mean we have to rescreen the patient twice in a three-month period to document remission? Am I interpreting this incorrectly?

Michigan has the Telemedicine Parity Law that requires private payers to cover e-vists comparable to that ofan in-person visit. Would be nice to especially be able to provide to CPC+ patients as TCM is an eligible code, though, not with the originating site exception.\n",

I have a general idea of how we would like to track these patients and utilize our EHR and/or excel to remind us when the 30 day period is approaching, but would like to see what some other practices are doing to ensure providers are not billing a regular office visit code during a hospital f/u visit, and what methods practices are using to postpone billing any codes until the 30th day, etc. Any information or resources is much appreciated\n",

      "As we anticipate the modified FFS payment, I'm trying to determine the best way to post the payments to our financial data base. The deferred percentage ( we selected10%/90%) is actually a reduction in our standard FFS Medicare payments. So, by reducing the Medicare claims by the selected percentage that will reduce the amount of A/R receipts that typically would cover our general overhead. My question is how will we need to report these funds at year end? Will our CPC+ CMS payments need to match the CMS total on a CPC+ budget format? Or can we record the 10% to our A/R receipts? Or, should we redefine our standard overhead to recognize staff who are working to support CPC+ measures and include them in the CPC+ budget? I apologize if this is confusing.

      "Someone asked about the number of patients assigned per care coordinator.....we have used and RN Care Coordinator (RNCC)model both inside and outside of CPCi. The literature suggests, and we find relatively correct that anywhere between 75 and 250 patients/RNCC is probably right, depending on complexity. In our case, there is no way for an RNCC to deal with more than 100-150 patients.This is allowing for about .5-.6 FTE for this (RNCC)job outside of other duties, meetings etc. This means phone calls, one on one visits (billed as 99211), risk stratification:andIt of course varies on documentation requirements and whether these are linked to your EMR. We have had the experience of using many risk stratification tools, unlinked to the EMR (MCG, Truvan and others) and the greater the documentation requirements the lower the personal impact on patients, and less value seen by the physicians/providers in practice. If you have to \"double enter\" patients into some sort of \"counting\" scheme (IE stratification and tracking not linked to your EMR), this is a barrier to integrated services and efficient care delivery. Double documentation reduces the effectiveness of coordinators very significantly.Some commercial interests (outside care management companies, insurers) would suggest that this is not a big enough panel size for RNCC's but we are dealing with multiplephysical, mental health, and social determinants in the cases managed by our coordinators. IE High Risk. \n",

I may be misunderstanding the numerator/denominator, but if we enter it once, it goes to the numerator and denominator, if they have two more visits and we don't enter that particular item again, the numerator stays the same but the denominator raises by two?? Is that how this will work? Using the mammogram as an example again - the numerator states - women with one or more mammograms during the measurement period or the 15 months prior to the measurement period. Denominator states - equals initial population. Record once in the EHR or at each visit during 2017? Any help is appreciated!!\n",

Or is there supposed to be a summation (Step 1 + Step 2) risk score? If it's the latter, what does that look like?For example, let's assume I'm using claims (HCC) for my Step 1 risk stratification and Step 2 is done with AAFP's 'Risk-Stratified Care Management and Coordination' algorithm.
