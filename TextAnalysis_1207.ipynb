      "As most of you already know the Controlling Hypertension eCQM measure is a required reporting measure for CPC+ PY 2018. As we are closing and reporting Hypertension Measure numbers for CPC+ 2017, we noticed some areas for possible improvement, not just with our process of dealing with hypertension patients but with the eCQM itself. During our process of closing PY 2017 patient gaps, we noticed that patients who had been seen by providers for a follow up visit on a previously reported high blood pressure were not counting in our numerator as ?controlled.? Initially we were unsure why these patients were not counting in our numerator, but after further investigation we discovered that our providers coded the visit as a ?no charge? visit. These visits were care management visits performed by the provider. The controlled blood pressure, however, was not counted toward our numerator because the visit was coded as a ?no charge? visit. Many could argue that another trained team member, (i.e. a care manager), could be doing care management for this patient?s blood pressure; however, if this were the case, we still would not get credit for the patient?s controlled blood pressure for two reasons:A provider did not see the patientThe provider did not charge for the visitOffering care management services not only helps the patient maintain and control their health but also helps reduce the cost of healthcare. Given that here are a few questions:Why does a provider have to bill for services for in order to get credit for the patient/visit in this measure? Does charging for the visit change the fact that the patient had a controlled blood pressure?If a patient has already been seen for a visit with a provider within the measure year, comes into the clinic and sees another member of the care team (i.e. the care manager), and the patient has a documented, controlled blood pressure, why are we not allowing this to count towards the measure? Isn?t the care manager part of the ?care team? that the CPC+ model strongly encourages?The provider reviews the notes from care manager visits and can intervene with a visit if needed. Is this not a great example of smarter spending and also of ?top of license? for care team members?How can we expect to reduce costs if we have to charge patients for any visit that is required to count for measures?Essentially to capture a controlled blood pressure and to also get credit for this in our eCQM reporting, a provider has to see the patient and also has to charge for the visit. This seems contradictory to what we are trying accomplish under the CPC+ triple aim ? namely better care and smarter spending. Is anyone else encountering this? If so, how are you addressing it?\n",

This variance comes from different attribution methods and time frames. Because we report on our \"active patient panel\" for total practice patients but recorded the carrier provided \"attributed\" patients by carrier, it appear that our percentage of patient participating in CPC+ is lower. Will this be considered a negative outcome for our practice. 2) CMS has limitations on the type of expenses allowed using CPC+ funds. However, various carriers had no limitations on what the funds could be used for. When entering the expense totals, there was no way to identify what CPC+ revenue funds were used for specific expenses. Is there a way to add supporting clarification on expenses? 3) CMS and another major carrier for our practice included FFS Alternative payments as part of their CPC+ financial support. The FFS Alternative Payments were included in the CPC+ revenue. However, these funds were an off-set of A/R income. This made the total CPC+ revenue appear much greater than what we considered as additional CPC+ revenue support. So, it appears that we would have a large amount of CPC+ revenue carry over from 2017. From our perspective, we need to match revenue and expenses. So we either need to move the FFS Alternative Payments out of CPC+ revenue or move standard practice expenses over to CPC+ to reflect the lost A/R income. I hope that makes sense and would appreciate input. Thanks, Carol\n",

However, our system (which includes 8 Track 2 CPC+ practices) is somewhat unique in that we have interchangeable staff, providers and patients across our clinics. Therefore, it is not feasible for our system to conduct individual PFAC meetings without causing a great deal of frustration and confusion for staff, providers and patients. Rather, for the past 4 + years we have had a highly-functioning, system-wide PFAC with patient representation from all of our clinics, and attended by our organization?s leadership, administration, and providers from across our organization, so that we can implement systemic changes/improvements so that patients, staff and providers are not confused by inconsistencies as they move from one physical location to another. Are there other systems in CPC+ with these same challenges?We have been able to overcome this challenge in other programs, including CPC classic, and SIM when practice facilitation was required to have meetings at each individual office caused large problems because certain things were being changed at one location rather than across our organization and PCPs and patients, alike, complained because of the confusion when they were working or being seen at another location. We were able to come to an agreement that with participation from each location, we could have one central meeting to achieve the intent of the requirement for meetings. I?m hoping that this will be the same way. Can a collaborative approach meet the CPC+ requirement if we can document the system-wide representation? Thanks in advance. \n",

      "Now that it's 2018, what's your HCC strategy? It's a new year, so all HCC scores have reset back to zero, and the CY 2018 HCC scores will impact CMF payments Q3-2019 through Q2-2020:Do you have an EHR solution? Other IT vendor?Maybe an external tracking spreadsheet?An awesome in-house coder?I'd love to hear everyone's ideas on how to keep track of HCC's, how to ensure they get billed correctly, how to make sure they don't get forgotten, HCC 'tips and tricks', and the like.I'll start. As I see it, there are two elements to good HCC coding. One is to code as accurately as possible and re-code each HCC ICD-10 every year (e.g. they probably have the same below-the-knee amputation Z89.519 this year that they had last year.) The other element is to 'mine' the medical record for missed opportunities (e.g. senile purpura D69.2) Doing Annual Wellness Visits is a good way to keep track of those codes than need billed and re-billed every year. I'm still struggling with how to 'mine' the chart for missed opportunities.BTW, a good resource to checkHCC scores ishttp://www.hccuniversity.com/risk-score-calculator/BTW#2, don't forget the MEAT. For a diagnosis to be properly documented/supported, it must have the following four elements addressed in the progress note:Monitoring, Evaluating, Assessing/Addressing, & Treating. In other words, if someone comes in for a sinus infection, you can't just throw a bunch of HCC ICD-10 codes in the chart. You must include the MEAT! So if you address their E11.65 Type 2 Diabetes with hyperglycemia when they are in for the sinus infection, you should document that and include it.\n",

Part of the function 2 requirements indicate that we should \"ensure patients with ED visits receive a follow up interaction within one week of discharge\". We have patient care coordinators (LPN care managers) in place for these calls. However, I'm curious to know if actual in office appointments count as a \"follow up interaction\" as well?

My understanding of the AWV is that Z00.00 or Z00.01 codes apply unless new problems are found, and if addressed go in with a -25 modifier. If E&M codes are applied, a co-pay is needed. Some plans are now encouraging a \"physical\" separate from the AWV in which problems and codes are documented. Corresponding to this, the few beneficiariesattributed to me with no risk assignedwere those who had only come in for yearly wellness visits. Please clarify with cms. Thanks\n",

      "I have a question about the use of Care Management Fees (CMF) for certain services. We have been talking with a private Primary Care Group of over 200 providers, who operate a very efficient Inpatient service at a hospital that is not part of our system. Through utilization of a lot of wraparound services they have a readmission rate in the single digits. We want to utilize our CPC resources to provide new care opportunities for our patients around hospital sensitive conditions at a hospital that is not part of our system, but where a number of our patients receive their care.\n",
      "\n",
      "We would like to have this group manage our patients who go to this Hospital, and although the providers will bill for their professional services, the wraparound services are not billable so we will need to help support that. I am emailing to see if we can use CMF dollars for that?\n",
      "\n",
      "They have transition of care services as follows:  An RN and physician in the ED from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. to assess if patients need to be admitted they work with and collaborate with the ED physicians of that institution. They often schedule patients to see their primary care provider the following day such that admission and or an observation unit  stay is not need it. All of our patients who go to the ED would receive the service. They also track patient utilization data and share that with us. For patients who need observation they have  an inpatient observation unit that can  also be used to bypass the ER for all but the sickest. They staff the unit with  transition of care nurses to support the physicians in this environment. We would be able to contact them for a direct observation admit and bypass the ED. They also do post-hospital follow up and 48 hour phone call evaluations, but we would continue to do that ourselves. For patients who are admitted they have an inpatient support center staffed 24/7 / 365 with their Physicians, Pharmacists,  and Critical Care Nurses to efficiently manage patients both in the observation unit, inpatient setting, and ER Area.\n",

      "As most of you already know the Controlling Hypertension eCQM measure is a required reporting measure for CPC+ PY 2018. As we are closing and reporting Hypertension Measure numbers for CPC+ 2017, we noticed some areas for possible improvement, not just with our process of dealing with hypertension patients but with the eCQM itself. During our process of closing PY 2017 patient gaps, we noticed that patients who had been seen by providers for a follow up visit on a previously reported high blood pressure were not counting in our numerator as ?controlled.? Initially we were unsure why these patients were not counting in our numerator, but after further investigation we discovered that our providers coded the visit as a ?no charge? visit. These visits were care management visits performed by the provider. The controlled blood pressure, however, was not counted toward our numerator because the visit was coded as a ?no charge? visit. Many could argue that another trained team member, (i.e. a care manager), could be doing care management for this patient?s blood pressure; however, if this were the case, we still would not get credit for the patient?s controlled blood pressure for two reasons:A provider did not see the patientThe provider did not charge for the visitOffering care management services not only helps the patient maintain and control their health but also helps reduce the cost of healthcare. Given that here are a few questions:Why does a provider have to bill for services for in order to get credit for the patient/visit in this measure? Does charging for the visit change the fact that the patient had a controlled blood pressure?If a patient has already been seen for a visit with a provider within the measure year, comes into the clinic and sees another member of the care team (i.e. the care manager), and the patient has a documented, controlled blood pressure, why are we not allowing this to count towards the measure? Isn?t the care manager part of the ?care team? that the CPC+ model strongly encourages?The provider reviews the notes from care manager visits and can intervene with a visit if needed. Is this not a great example of smarter spending and also of ?top of license? for care team members?How can we expect to reduce costs if we have to charge patients for any visit that is required to count for measures?Essentially to capture a controlled blood pressure and to also get credit for this in our eCQM reporting, a provider has to see the patient and also has to charge for the visit. This seems contradictory to what we are trying accomplish under the CPC+ triple aim ? namely better care and smarter spending. Is anyone else encountering this? If so, how are you addressing it?\n",

      "After completing the Financial Reporting, I have 3 questions that I'd like feedback on. 1) The number of lives reflected on the carrier attribution reports sometimes vary greatly compared to what we consider our current \"active patient panel\". This variance comes from different attribution methods and time frames. Because we report on our \"active patient panel\" for total practice patients but recorded the carrier provided \"attributed\" patients by carrier, it appear that our percentage of patient participating in CPC+ is lower. Will this be considered a negative outcome for our practice. 2) CMS has limitations on the type of expenses allowed using CPC+ funds. However, various carriers had no limitations on what the funds could be used for. When entering the expense totals, there was no way to identify what CPC+ revenue funds were used for specific expenses. Is there a way to add supporting clarification on expenses? 3) CMS and another major carrier for our practice included FFS Alternative payments as part of their CPC+ financial support. The FFS Alternative Payments were included in the CPC+ revenue. However, these funds were an off-set of A/R income. This made the total CPC+ revenue appear much greater than what we considered as additional CPC+ revenue support. So, it appears that we would have a large amount of CPC+ revenue carry over from 2017. From our perspective, we need to match revenue and expenses. So we either need to move the FFS Alternative Payments out of CPC+ revenue or move standard practice expenses over to CPC+ to reflect the lost A/R income. I hope that makes sense and would appreciate input. Thanks, Carol\n",

      "We are seeking guidance regarding PFAC requirements in 2018 due to our unique circumstances. We understand that the requirement states that PFACs must be specific to each CPC+ ID #. However, our system (which includes 8 Track 2 CPC+ practices) is somewhat unique in that we have interchangeable staff, providers and patients across our clinics. Therefore, it is not feasible for our system to conduct individual PFAC meetings without causing a great deal of frustration and confusion for staff, providers and patients. Rather, for the past 4 + years we have had a highly-functioning, system-wide PFAC with patient representation from all of our clinics, and attended by our organization?s leadership, administration, and providers from across our organization, so that we can implement systemic changes/improvements so that patients, staff and providers are not confused by inconsistencies as they move from one physical location to another. Are there other systems in CPC+ with these same challenges?We have been able to overcome this challenge in other programs, including CPC classic, and SIM when practice facilitation was required to have meetings at each individual office caused large problems because certain things were being changed at one location rather than across our organization and PCPs and patients, alike, complained because of the confusion when they were working or being seen at another location. We were able to come to an agreement that with participation from each location, we could have one central meeting to achieve the intent of the requirement for meetings. I?m hoping that this will be the same way. Can a collaborative approach meet the CPC+ requirement if we can document the system-wide representation? Thanks in advance. \n",

      "Now that it's 2018, what's your HCC strategy? It's a new year, so all HCC scores have reset back to zero, and the CY 2018 HCC scores will impact CMF payments Q3-2019 through Q2-2020:Do you have an EHR solution? Other IT vendor?Maybe an external tracking spreadsheet?An awesome in-house coder?I'd love to hear everyone's ideas on how to keep track of HCC's, how to ensure they get billed correctly, how to make sure they don't get forgotten, HCC 'tips and tricks', and the like.I'll start. As I see it, there are two elements to good HCC coding. One is to code as accurately as possible and re-code each HCC ICD-10 every year (e.g. they probably have the same below-the-knee amputation Z89.519 this year that they had last year.) The other element is to 'mine' the medical record for missed opportunities (e.g. senile purpura D69.2) Doing Annual Wellness Visits is a good way to keep track of those codes than need billed and re-billed every year. I'm still struggling with how to 'mine' the chart for missed opportunities.BTW, a good resource to checkHCC scores ishttp://www.hccuniversity.com/risk-score-calculator/BTW#2, don't forget the MEAT. For a diagnosis to be properly documented/supported, it must have the following four elements addressed in the progress note:Monitoring, Evaluating, Assessing/Addressing, & Treating. In other words, if someone comes in for a sinus infection, you can't just throw a bunch of HCC ICD-10 codes in the chart. You must include the MEAT! So if you address their E11.65 Type 2 Diabetes with hyperglycemia when they are in for the sinus infection, you should document that and include it.\n",
