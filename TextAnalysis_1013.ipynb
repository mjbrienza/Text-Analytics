      "<p>Are the maximum and minimum thresholds used to measure practice performance on ecQMs, CAHPS, IHU and EDU for PBIP available yet? We?re trying to model PBIP retention with some measure performance assumptions and it would be helpful to have the actual thresholds that will be used by CMS. For reference, see CPC+ Payment Methodologies document published January 1, 2017, Section 4.1.4, PBIP &gt; Incentive Structure. Relevant excerpt: ?Practice performance is measured against absolute performance thresholds. The minimum and maximum thresholds are determined from a <u>benchmark population external to CPC+ participation.</u> In turn, a practice?s own performance relative to this <u>benchmark</u> determines the incentive amount the practice retains? In program year one, the minimum threshold is set to the 50th percentile of performance in the <u>benchmark population</u> for clinical quality, patient experience of care, and utilization? The maximum threshold is set to the 80th percentile of performance on the measure in the <u>benchmark population</u> for clinical quality, patient experience of care, and utilization.? Thank you.</p>\n",
